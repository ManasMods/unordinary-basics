Unordinary Basics is a forge 1.18.2 mod which focuses on improving the vanilla experience and adding content into the game where Mojang missed. 
The mod will be staying in 1.18.2 due to personal reasons the mod author has.

Many thanks to Contrabass26 and MrProfessor. Without these two, this mod would not be possible.

And many thanks to Kaupenjoe. It was his tutorials which made me (Nieadni), want to get into Minecraft modding.

**Adding Compatibility**

May eventually have a guide on adding mod compatibility with UB.
