**About**

Unordinary Basics is a Minecraft Forge Mod which focuses on improving the vanilla experience by adding QoL changes while also adding features which keep close to the vanilla feel.

Most of the ideas for the mod came about from playthroughs the devs have made. For example, have you ever been playing Vanilla Minecraft and go to build something but go 'Darn, I wish X was a thing' or 'Why can't I craft / smelt this?'. Well that is the premise behind the mod.
